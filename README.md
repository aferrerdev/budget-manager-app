### Budget Manager App ###

## Main objective
The main purpose of this repository is to play around the new Ionic v4 framework which is in beta.
Also to work in a cleaner way to improve my coding skills and decouple all core logic from the frontend layer.

## App requirements
This app should enable the user to add their savings and expenses to calculate the saving for the nexts months based in the user fixed montlhy expenses and benefits.
To allow the user to complete this need, the next features should be developed:
    - Enable the user to entry the amount of savings.
    - Enable the users to insert their monthly fixed expenses and benefits.
    - Calculate the total savings for the nexts months based in the user information.

(In construction) Let's play!
